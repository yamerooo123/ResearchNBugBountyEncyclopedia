<h1>Year 1: STUDYING OSCP BE BACK IN A MONTH. Exam date: Oct 16. CURRENT STATE: WAITING FOR OFFSEC EMAIL! </h1>


<h1>About Me: Want to know who i am?</h1>
<p>I do bug bounties from time to time. I study many pentesting certs just because those look cool and I need OSCP to apply for a job. My hobby is researching on open-source projects and sometimes work on Linux binary project. When i look at source code, at first i feel like i know everything but to be honest with you my head keeps saying ERROR 404.</p>

<p>My philosophy i live by is there are only people who know and who don't. You don't know today doesn't mean you are dumb. Different people different stories, I like to hear their stories because good stories make the best knowledge!</p>

I like to think and think again. like I'm living in the future where my head is constantly thinking all possibilities. this habit of mine is like a double-edge sword. It helps me see the outcome while stress is killing me. If you see me staring at the blank space please forgive me I'm having a life in my head. lol

<b>My only regret is i should've found my passion early. i wonder how much potential would i become if i started my journey 2 years early.</b>
