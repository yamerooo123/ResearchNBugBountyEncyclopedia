<h3>API Enumeration</h3> 

 web fuzzing using **Burp Scanner** (alternative way is web fuzzer such as Feroxbuster or OWASP ZAP)

| API Endpoint Enumeration  | Method |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Burp Scanner  | automation process  |
| Read API doc  | usually in /api directory  |
| Hidden API endpoint | Burp intruder or Gobuster |


It is also worth checking on JSON, YAML or any JavaScript files as it may contain API endpoints.

| HTTP Method  | Desc. |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| GET  | request resources  |
| POST  | submit requests  |
| Patch | update or modify |
| OPTIONS | see available HTTP method |



When constructing a request, the JSON format is usually look like this in Burp Suite

```
{
  "username": tester,
  "password": tester
}
```

<h3>Identifying supported HTTP methods</h3>

Basically use **OPTIONS** to see available HTTP options. In HTB, this technique is called **HTTP Tampering** 

<h3>Type Confusion</h3>

The web server sometimes interprets the request differently if the content type isn't what it expect to be.

Usually it involves around **content-type**

```
Example

Content-type: Application/json

This tells the web server, this request contains JSON data
```

<h3>Hidden API endpoint</h3>

Let say you found 
```
POST /api/user/add
```

You can try to fuzzing other endpoint in **/add** using wordlists. You might find other endpoints that look like **/api/user/delete**, **/api/user/update** etc using **Burp Intruder**.

<h3>Mass Assignment Vulnerability</h3>

This attack allows the attackers to insert unknown data parameters in hidden parameters.

```
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "isAdmin": "false"
}
```

<h3>Server-side parameter pollution</h3>

This attacks allows the attackers to inject payload in input which later on will be sent to internal system where external users couldnt access. If the input isn't sanitize, it could lead to unauthorized access.It is worth checking every input in API endpoints. We could use query syntax like #, &, = to test.

**Test scenario**
```
GET /userSearch?name=peter&back=/home
```

Use **#** to test. **%23** is the encoded format of #

```
GET /userSearch?name=peter%23foo&back=/home
```
