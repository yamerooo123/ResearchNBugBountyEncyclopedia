## <h2>API Pentesting</h2>

<h3>API Enumeration</h3> 

 web fuzzing using **Burp Scanner** (alternative way is web fuzzer such as Feroxbuster or OWASP ZAP)

| API Endpoint Enumeration  | Method |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Burp Scanner  | automation process  |
| Read API doc  | usually in /api directory  |
| Hidden API endpoint | Burp intruder or Gobuster |


It is also worth checking on JSON, YAML or any JavaScript files as it may contain API endpoints

When constructing a request, the JSON format is usually look like this in Burp Suite

```
{
  "username": tester,
  "password": tester
}
```

<h3>Identifying supported HTTP methods</h3>

Basically use **OPTIONS** to see available HTTP options. In HTB, this technique is called **HTTP Tampering** 

<h3>Type Confusion</h3>

The web server sometimes interprets the request differently if the content type isn't what it expect to be.

Usually it involves around **content-type**

```
Example

Content-type: Application/json

This tells the web server, this request contains JSON data
```

<h3>Hidden API endpoint</h3>

Let say you found 
```
POST /api/user/add
```

You can try to fuzzing other endpoint in **/add** using wordlists. You might find other endpoints that look like **/api/user/delete**, **/api/user/update** etc using **Burp Intruder** .
