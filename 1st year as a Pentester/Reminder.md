<h2>Never forget why you are here. This is a reminder of my failures and disappointments. I will overcome it and be a better version of me.</h2>

<h1>Report</h1>

When writing findings, the reproduction step needs to be **specific**.

Ex. you should use words like **"authenticated attacker"**, **"the X parameter is vulnerable to .."**, **"Figures are needed to be clear"**. 
To make a perfect report, i need to think as a client and ask myself **"what am i expected to know in this report"**, **"is this understandable?"**, **"can i follow the reproduction steps?"**, **"how can these solutions help me to solve the problem and how i can implement them in my app"**.

<h1>Communication</h1>

-It is ok to slow down and think before saying anything. because if you don't understand what you are saying then what is the point of pretending to understand? 

-It is ok to ask questions. This is a group work not an individual work, i can ask help from co workers. no need to be self-reliant all the time.
