<h1>Assembly Language</h1>

-It is a low-level language that allow human to interact with the computer since the computer knows only 1 or 0.

-This instruction can be inject to the computer memory

HIGH LEVEL vs LOW LEVEL

Example of Assembly code

```
mov rax, 1
mov rdi, 1
mov rsi, message
mov rdx, 12
syscall

mov rax, 60
mov rdi, 0
syscall
```

The shellcode would look like this or we can call it hex code.

```
48 c7 c0 01
48 c7 c7 01
48 8b 34 25
48 c7 c2 0d
0f 05

48 c7 c0 3c
48 c7 c7 00
0f 05
```

then the computer changes the shellcode into binary

```
01001000 11000111 11000000 00000001
01001000 11000111 11000111 00000001
01001000 10001011 00110100 00100101
01001000 11000111 11000010 00001101 
00001111 00000101

01001000 11000111 11000000 00111100 
01001000 11000111 11000111 00000000 
00001111 00000101
```

Tip: Java operates similarly to assemly. To make it easier to understand.
```
Java Bytecode > shell code or machine code using Java runtime > binary
```

<h1>Computer Architecture</h1>

CPU or Computer Processing Unit has 3 components:

-Control Unit (CU)

-Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)

-Registers

MEMORY
---

Memory in CPU have 2 types.

1. Cache - Pretty fast and faster than RAM
2. RAM - is bigger than cache 

When programs are running. it send intructions to storage > RAM to prepare for CPU since storage couldn't handle both things at the same time. 

RAM
---

There are 4 components in RAM.

1. Stack - Has a Last-in First-out (LIFO) design and is fixed in size. Data in it can only be accessed in a specific order by push-ing and pop-ing data.
2. Heap - Has a hierarchical design and is therefore much larger and more versatile in storing data, as data can be stored and retrieved in any order. However, this makes the heap slower than the Stack.
3. Data - Has two parts: Data, which is used to hold variables, and .bss, which is used to hold unassigned variables (i.e., buffer memory for later allocation).
4. Text - Main assembly instructions are loaded into this segment to be fetched and executed by the CPU.
