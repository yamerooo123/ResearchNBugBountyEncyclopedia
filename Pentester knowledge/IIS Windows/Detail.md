<h1>Quick Checklist for IIS Windows Pentesting</h1>

1.**Internal IP Information disclosure:** Try removing a **host header** and use **HTTP 1.0** to perform the test. This happens due to the it couldn't find the host to route to so i use a default configuration which is why it leaks out the internal IP address.

2.**Webshell via web.config:** If you spot file upload function, try uploading .config which is like **.htaccess** in apache server. Use the following URL;

web.config webshell - [HERE](https://github.com/yamerooo123/ResearchNBugBountyEncyclopedia/blob/main/Custom%20tools/Inventory/IIS%2010.0/web.config)

3.**Directory Fuzzing:** To find IIS default folders, use the below tool.

[IIS Shortname scanner](https://github.com/irsdl/IIS-ShortName-Scanner) 
```
java -jar iis_shortname_scanner.jar [URL]
```
